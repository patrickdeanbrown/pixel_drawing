## Notes for Automation Integration

The following items from this manual checklist could potentially be automated in future iterations:

1. **Color Accuracy Verification**: Automated screenshot comparison
2. **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated timing measurements
3. **File Format Validation**: Automated save/load integrity checks
4. **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Automated resource usage tracking
5. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Automated multi-platform test execution

However, the following will always require human validation:
- Visual aesthetics and user experience
- Subjective performance assessment (smoothness, responsiveness)
- Accessibility and usability evaluation
- Edge case behavior assessment
- Real-world workflow validation
